# WIP: Not stable for use

# vim-go-utils

A subset of features taken from the popular [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go) plugin.

# Warning

This plugin is not compatible with the original vim-go plugin, if you need more features than this
pugin offers, use vim-go instead.

## Disclaimer

This plugin was made for personal use as I only care about a small set of features in vim-go, and
using the full plugin disrupted my workflow.
